## Research Notes

### Market Segments Found:
1. **Existing wallet analytics platforms** - Need social layer data to complete their offering
2. **Crypto marketing agencies** - Need tools to identify and reach token holders  
3. **Individual marketing consultants** - Looking for competitive advantages for client work
4. **Token projects** - Need better ways to engage their holder communities

- Wallet tracking exists but lacks social context for outreach
- Manual research is time-consuming for BD teams
- Difficulty identifying genuine holders vs airdrop farmers

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: For Existing Wallet Analytics Platforms
**Subject**: Add social mapping to your wallet analytics

Hi [Name],

Saw your recent post about targeting wallets instead of followers - totally agree. 

We're building walletlink.social, which adds the social layer you're missing. Instead of just knowing wallet balances, you can see:
- Twitter/Farcaster profiles behind each wallet  
- Follower counts & influence levels
- ENS names for easier outreach

Would love to show you how this could enhance [their product]. Interested in a 15-min demo?

[Your name]

### Template 2: For Crypto Marketing Consultants/Agencies
**Subject**: New tool for crypto BD teams

Hi [Name],

Just found your content about crypto BD strategies - really insightful stuff.

Quick question: How do you currently identify which token holders to target for partnerships or outreach?

We built walletlink.social to solve exactly this. Upload a token's holder list, get back Twitter handles + follower counts + ENS names. Perfect for:
- Finding influencers among your holders
- BD outreach to key community members  
- Airdrop notification campaigns

Free trial available if you want to test it on a current client project.

Best,
[Your name]

### Template 3: For Token Projects
**Subject**: Turn your holders into your marketing team

Hey [Name],

Love what you're building with [project]. Quick question about your go-to-market:

How do you currently reach your token holders for announcements or partnerships?

Most projects we talk to are doing mass Discord broadcasts or hoping for organic Twitter engagement. But there's a better way.

walletlink.social lets you:
1. Upload your holder addresses
2. Get their Twitter/Farcaster profiles  
3. Directly engage with your biggest supporters

[Project] has [X] holders - imagine knowing which ones have 10k+ Twitter followers and can amplify your message.

Worth a quick call to show you how it works?
