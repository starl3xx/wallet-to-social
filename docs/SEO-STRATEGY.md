**CTA:** Upload your CSV

### Value Props (3 columns)

**2. One Price, Lifetime Access**
> $149 for 10K wallets, $420 for unlimited. No monthly fees. No enterprise contracts.

**3. All Major Sources**
> We check ENS, Web3.bio, and Farcaster to maximize your match rate.

### Social Proof Section

**Headline:** See what others found

Display RecentWins component showing:
- Wallet count processed
- Match rate (e.g., "22% - 9x industry avg")
- Twitter/Farcaster breakdown

### Comparison Section (fold 2)

**Headline:** Why teams switch from Addressable

| | walletlink.social | Addressable |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Wallet → Social only | Full marketing suite |
| **Pricing** | $149 - $420 one-time | $1000s/month subscription |
| **Access** | Instant, self-serve | Sales calls required |
| **Setup** | Upload CSV, done | Onboarding process |
| **Contracts** | None | Enterprise agreements |

**CTA:** Start your first lookup free (1,000 wallets)

### How It Works Section

1. **Upload** - Drop your CSV with wallet addresses
2. **Process** - We check ENS, Web3.bio, Neynar for matches
3. **Export** - Download CSV or export to Twitter List

### FAQ Section (Schema markup opportunity)

**Q: What sources do you use?**
> We aggregate data from ENS text records, Web3.bio (which indexes multiple protocols), and Neynar for Farcaster. This gives you the highest match rate without needing to configure multiple APIs yourself.

**Q: How accurate are the results?**
> Our match rates average 15-25% depending on your wallet list, which is 6-10x higher than industry average (~2.5%). We only return verified connections - no guesses.

**Q: Why not use Addressable?**
> Addressable is a full web3 marketing platform - great if you need attribution, ads, and CRM. But if you just need wallet-to-social lookups, you're paying for features you won't use. We focus on one thing and do it well.

**Q: Can I try before buying?**
> Yes! Free tier includes 1,000 wallets - no credit card required.
