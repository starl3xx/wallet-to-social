# walletlink.social Update: Farcaster Integration is Live

Hey there,

Quick update: **Farcaster integration is now live on walletlink.social.**

If you've ever stared at a list of wallet addresses wondering how to actually reach those people, this one's for you.

## What's New

When you upload wallet addresses to walletlink.social, we now check Farcaster's verified address database alongside ENS, Web3.bio, and on-chain records.

The result: **3x more matches** compared to ENS-only lookups.

Here's what you get:
- **Farcaster profiles** for any wallet with a connected account
- **Follower counts** so you can prioritize high-reach holders
- **Verified Twitter handles** pulled from Farcaster (more reliable than ENS text records)

Our match rate is now sitting at **22%**—that's 9x better than the industry average of 2.5%.

## Why This Matters

Farcaster isn't just growing (10x DAU increase in 2024). It's becoming where Web3 actually lives.

More importantly: Farcaster verified addresses are cryptographically provable. When someone connects their wallet, that connection is real. No guessing. No stale ENS records.

For token projects, DAOs, and NFT collections, this means more of your holders are now findable.

## Trend Watch: What We're Seeing

**1. Token-Gated Communities Are Evolving**

Projects are moving beyond "hold NFT → access Discord." We're seeing sophisticated holder reward programs, tiered access, and governance incentives.

The challenge? You need to know who your holders are to reward them. That's where wallet identity comes in.

**2. Airdrop Strategy Is Shifting**

LayerZero flagged 800K addresses as Sybil attackers. Projects are getting smarter about distribution—targeting genuine community members with social proof, not just wallet activity.

Quality targeting requires knowing *who* is behind the wallet.
