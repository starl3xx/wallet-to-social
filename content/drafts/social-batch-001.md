# Social Media Batch - Farcaster Launch

## Post 1: Problem Hook (Twitter/X)
```
You have 10,000 wallet addresses.

You can't DM any of them.

This is the wallet identity problem. We just made it 3x easier to solve.

walletlink.social now supports Farcaster 🟣

## Post 2: Data Point (Twitter/X)
```
22% match rate vs 2.5% industry average.

That's 9x more token holders you can actually reach.

Farcaster integration is live on walletlink.social

Upload your holder list. Find their socials.

## Post 3: Farcaster-native (Farcaster)
```
Farcaster verified addresses just changed the wallet identity game.

Before: "Is this ENS text record even real?"
Now: Cryptographically verified. No guessing.

walletlink.social now pulls Farcaster + follower counts for every lookup.

## Post 4: Use Case (Twitter/X)
```
One DAO went from 5% to 22% governance participation.

How? They found their holders' social profiles with walletlink.social and reached out directly.

40% response rate on personalized outreach vs 2% on broadcasts.

That's the difference.

## Post 5: Question Engagement (Twitter/X + Farcaster)
```
Token projects: how do you currently reach your holders?

A) Discord announcements (and hope they see it)
B) Twitter broadcasts
C) Direct outreach to known socials
D) You don't 😅

C is now 3x easier → walletlink.social
