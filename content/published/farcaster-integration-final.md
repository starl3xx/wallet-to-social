# walletlink.social Now Supports Farcaster: 3x More Wallet Matches

You have 10,000 wallet addresses. Now what?

You can't DM 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D.

This is the problem every token project faces. The blockchain tells you exactly who holds your token. But wallets don't have inboxes. You can't tag them on Twitter. You can't @ them on Farcaster. You can't invite them to your Discord.

The wallet identity problem has plagued Web3 since day one.

**Today, we're launching Farcaster integration—and it changes everything.**

## Why Farcaster Changes the Game

Farcaster isn't just another social network. It's the first major platform where verified wallet addresses are a core feature.

When someone connects their wallet to Farcaster, that verification is cryptographically provable. Not an ENS text record that might be outdated. Not a self-reported Twitter handle. A verified, on-chain connection between identity and wallet.

The numbers:

- **Farcaster DAU: 50K → 400K+** in 2024 (10x growth)
- **80% of active crypto builders** are now on Farcaster
- **Verified addresses** = reliable matching, no guessing

Farcaster is where Web3 lives. And now walletlink.social taps into it.

## What You Get

We've integrated the Neynar API to bring Farcaster data into every lookup.

### Farcaster Profiles in Results

Every wallet lookup now checks Farcaster's verified address database. Connected account? You'll see it alongside ENS, Twitter, and other profiles.

### Follower Counts for Prioritization

A holder with 50,000 Farcaster followers is a potential ambassador. One with 50 is a quiet supporter. Now you can tell the difference.

Our Priority Score factors this in:

```
Priority Score = Holdings × log₁₀(Followers + 1)
```

Surface your whales with reach—not just your whales.

### Verified Twitter Handles

Farcaster users often verify their Twitter on the platform. These verified handles are more reliable than ENS text records.

When we find a Farcaster profile, we pull the verified Twitter too. Another layer of accuracy.

### 3x More Matches

The bottom line:

| Source | Match Rate |
|--------|------------|
| ENS only | ~8% |
| + Farcaster | ~22% |
| Industry average | 2.5% |

**That's 9x better than average.** More matches = more holders you can reach.

## How It Works

Upload your CSV. We handle the rest.

Behind the scenes:
1. **Web3.bio** — ENS, Lens, and other identity sources
2. **Neynar API** — Farcaster profiles and verified addresses
3. **On-chain ENS** — direct text record lookups

Results cached 24 hours. 10K wallets in under 2 minutes.

## Real Results: DAO Case Study

One DAO had 8,000 token holders but 5% governance participation. They couldn't reach the holders they knew were engaged.

With walletlink.social + Farcaster:
- **1,800 holders identified** with social profiles (22%)
- **200 with significant reach** (10K+ followers)
- **Direct outreach: 40% response rate** (vs 2% broadcast)
- **Governance participation: 5% → 22%**

They built an ambassador program from their top 50 matches. The difference between knowing your holders and *reaching* them is everything.

## vs. The Competition

**Addressable** — Full CRM suite. Powerful but complex. If you just need wallet-to-identity resolution without the enterprise overhead, we're faster and simpler.

**Blaze** — Bundles enrichment with campaigns, community tools, subscriptions. Great if you need all that. If you want focused, pay-as-you-go lookups, we're leaner.

**Holder.xyz** — Analytics-focused. Shows holder composition. We're action-focused—giving you profiles to actually *reach* them. Complementary, not competing.

## Get Started

Farcaster integration is live now. No setup required.

1. Upload your wallet CSV
2. Get social profiles back—now with Farcaster
3. Export sorted by Priority Score

**10K wallets. Under 2 minutes. 22% match rate.**

## The Bigger Picture

Farcaster integration is a milestone in a larger shift: **wallets are becoming social profiles**.

Every on-chain action is public. Tokens held. NFTs collected. Votes cast. The data exists. What's been missing is the identity layer connecting wallets to people.

Farcaster is building that layer. ENS is building it. walletlink.social aggregates it all.

The wallet identity problem isn't solved. But we're getting closer.
