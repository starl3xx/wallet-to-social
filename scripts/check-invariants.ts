/**
 * The claims this codebase makes about what an attacker cannot do.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * On 2026-08-24 and 25, four separate defects shipped as far as review with the
 * same shape: a comment asserting a security property, and nothing anywhere
 * that could contradict it.
 *
 *   "possession of the payload is proof"      the fields are public onchain
 *   "an attacker also needs the reply"        they replay from their own socket
 *   "a header proves this is metered"         `Bearer hunter2` is not a key
 *   "this table is in the nightly dump"       it was in neither dump list
 *
 * Each was checkable in seconds. None was checked twice. The repo enforces
 * button radius, palette, contrast and control height on every pull request,
 * and enforced nothing about the money path.
 *
 * Every assertion below is therefore written as **the attacker**, doing the
 * thing a comment claims is impossible. A test of the happy path would have
 * passed on every one of those four days.
 *
 * ## Rules for adding to this file
 *
 * - Assert the refusal, not the success. `expect(refused)` catches a
 *   regression; `expect(worked)` catches a typo.
 * - Where a guard could pass by matching nothing, prove it can fail: the
 *   Drizzle case asserts that the NAIVE check misses what the real one finds.
 * - No database and no network. This runs on every pull request, from a fork,
 *   with no secrets.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/check-invariants.ts
