## Codebase Patterns

_Add reusable patterns here as you discover them. These persist across iterations._

### Database
- Path: `./data/content.db`
- Always close connections: `db.close()`
- JSON columns need `JSON.parse()`: `target_keywords`, `key_messages`, `data_points`

### Content
- Word count formula: `content.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 0).length`
- Draft naming: `[slug]-v[version].md`
- Published naming: `[slug]-final.md`

### Workflow
- Check available sources: `node src/content/list.js`
- Pipeline status: `npm run db:status`
- Query specific data: `node src/db/query.js [command]`

### Effective Patterns for Web3 Audience

**Hooks that worked:**
- Problem-first with specific numbers: "You have 10,000 wallet addresses. Who are these people?"
- Data point hooks: "2.5% to 22%: The match rate gap..."
- Direct pain point: "5% governance participation. Sound familiar?"

**Content structures:**
- Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA (blogs)
- Challenge → Discovery → Solution → Results (case studies)
- News → Context → Trend Watch → CTA (newsletters)
- Varied angles per batch (social)

**Data usage:**
- Specific percentages throughout (22%, 9x, 4x, 34%)
- Comparison tables (us vs industry, before/after)
- Math the reader can verify (10K wallets × 22% = 2,200 reachable)

**Web3-native elements:**
- Named competitors (Addressable, Blaze, Holder.xyz)
- Real protocols/trends (Farcaster, ENS, LayerZero)
- DAO governance as use case (resonates with builders)
- Priority Score formula explained (holdings × log followers)

**Voice:**
- Direct, no fluff
- Builder-to-builder tone
- Metric-heavy (every claim backed by numbers)
- Acknowledges complexity without dumbing down

### What to do differently next sprint
1. REVIEW cycles for thought leadership (wallet-identity-v1 could use v2)
2. More social posts - 5 is minimum, aim for 10+
3. Consider thread format for Twitter (higher engagement)
4. Add email sequence for COMM-3 (Priority Score feature)
